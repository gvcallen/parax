# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root: the glossary.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If either doesn't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag its absence; don't suggest creating it upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

Parax is a single-context repo: one `CONTEXT.md` and one `docs/adr/` (numbered `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, ...), both at the repo root. Neither is part of the mkdocs site.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-NNNN (its title), but worth reopening because…_
